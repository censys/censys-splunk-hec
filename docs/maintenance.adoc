# Censys Splunk HTTP Event Collector Integration Maintenance

The Censys Splunk HEC integration sits between the Censys Attack Surface Management platform and your Splunk instance.

## Persisting Data

The integration is designed to run in a Docker container. Docker containers are ephemeral, meaning that any and all data is gone when the container is removed.

The integration must store the most recent Censys logbook event ID that it processed when querying the API periodically so as not to reprocess events already seen.
In order to ensure this ID is not lost if the container is removed, a directory is created and mounted on the docker host: `$HOME/censys/storage/splunk-hec`.

The integration writes to the `lastId.json` file in the following path: `$HOME/censys/storage/splunk-hec/storage/tasks/ingestLogbook/input/`.

## Troubleshooting

If the integration ceases working, ensure that your Censys platform API key and Splunk HEC tokens are still valid.
